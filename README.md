# Tinkle Messenger
A cross platform chat application which features private and group chats.
Built using the Kivy framework.
# Features
* Global chat with anyone on Tinkle
* Groups
* Private chats
* Friends
* Status
* File sharing
* No need to remember password

# Usage
## Prerequisites
* Python 3 (tested with v3.7.3)
* Kivy (tested with v1.10.1)
* Plyer

## Server
* Have a webserver installed (I used [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) on Windows)
    * Place the files in [web server](web_server) to the htdocs directory

        [Video assistance  here](_install_help_content/web_server.mp4)
* Create a directory where you'd like to run the python server from
    * Place the files in [server](server) into the newly created directory
    * Run [initiate_address.py](server/initiate_address.py) and specify the webserver address (e.g. http://mysite.com/ or http://192.168.178.20/)

Short description of what the server .py files do is found [here](server/README.md).
##
Run
```
server.py
names.py
display_pics.py
```
And that should be it. The .py files in [here](web_server) do not neccessarily need to be run as they are more or less extras.
#
## Client
Run the following commands
```
pip install requests
pip install dataset
``` 
Run ```main.py``` to start up the client
```
Note: main.spec can be used to make an executable.
pyinstaller -F main.spec
```
